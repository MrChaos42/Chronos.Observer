# Spacetime-Structured Neural Architectures for Robust Computation Near Cosmic Boundaries

## Abstract
This paper introduces a novel computational paradigm based on the interplay between spacetime dynamics and advanced neural architectures, designed for robust and secure computations at cosmic boundaries such as black hole event horizons.

## Introduction
Advancements in theoretical physics and computational science have opened new frontiers in understanding how information and computation can be realized in extreme cosmic environments.

## Theoretical Foundations
### Spacetime Dynamics and Neural Computation
Computational frameworks at cosmic boundaries must account for the effects of spacetime curvature and the dynamic nature of event horizons.

### Quantum Neural Filtering for Dynamic Systems
Inspired by quantum filtering techniques, we extend traditional Kalman filtering to quantum neural filters.

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Curved Spacetime
We utilize the Deep Ritz Method, a variant of PINNs, to impose physical constraints on the neural architecture.

### State-Space Models and Emergent Stability
We construct a state-space model defined by a set of non-linear differential equations.

## Methodology
1. **Spacetime-Informed Neural Architecture Design**: Tensor-based layers are constructed to adapt computational pathways based on local curvature metrics.
2. **Quantum Neural Filtering**: Quantum noise terms are introduced to traditional Kalman filters, enhancing stability near quantum perturbations.
3. **Deep Ritz Method Application**: Physics-informed constraints are embedded within the network to simulate high-curvature phenomena.
4. **Secure Information Processing Protocols**: MeMoir-inspired covert channels are implemented for secure information transmission.
5. **Parameter Optimization via Lyapunov Stability**: Lyapunov conditions are employed to ensure that the architecture achieves optimal balance between computational stability and complexity.

## Experiments and Simulations
1. **Event Horizon Simulations**: Neural networks are tested under simulated spacetime geometries using Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics.
2. **Quantum Noise Analysis**: The effects of quantum fluctuations on computational accuracy are measured using modified Kalman gains.
3. **Strain Localization Modeling**: The Deep Ritz Method is used to model sharp discontinuities in high-energy fields.
4. **Secure Protocol Evaluation**: Information leakage is assessed under varying gravitational conditions using covert channel techniques.
5. **Lyapunov-Based Stability Testing**: Stability conditions are evaluated for varying curvatures and neural parameterizations.

## Results and Implications
Simulation results show that the proposed spacetime-structured neural architectures achieve stable, accurate, and secure computational performance under intense gravitational and quantum conditions, paving the way for future applications in cosmological computing and secure quantum communications.
