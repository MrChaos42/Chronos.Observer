**Abstract:**

The convergence of astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theory has opened new avenues for understanding and designing computational systems capable of operating under extreme physical conditions. Inspired by the Higgs Field as a Computation Field and the conceptual Event Horizon Computer, this paper presents a novel computational framework that integrates spacetime dynamics and neural network architectures to facilitate robust and secure computations near cosmic boundaries such as event horizons. Leveraging advancements in neural filtering, physics-informed computation, and state-space modeling, we propose a hybrid neural architecture that addresses the challenges of computational stability, information security, and parameter optimization in extreme gravitational environments. Through simulations based on the Deep Ritz Method and neural filtering techniques, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture in modeling and performing computations under conditions analogous to those near black hole event horizons. Our findings pave the way for innovative solutions in cosmic-scale information processing systems.

**Introduction:**

The intersection of astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theory has given rise to new paradigms for understanding and designing computational systems that can operate in extreme physical environments. The Higgs Field, a fundamental field of the universe, has been conceptualized as a computation field, where particles and forces interact to give rise to complex computational behaviors. Similarly, the Event Horizon Computer, a theoretical framework, has been proposed to harness the computational power of black holes. Inspired by these concepts, we propose a novel computational framework that integrates spacetime dynamics and neural network architectures to facilitate robust and secure computations near cosmic boundaries such as event horizons.

**Theoretical Foundations:**

Our framework is built on the following theoretical foundations:

1. **Spacetime Dynamics and Neural Computation:** We examine how spacetime curvature and event horizons can influence neural computation. By embedding spacetime metrics into neural architectures, we aim to create models that inherently account for the dynamic nature of cosmic boundaries.

5. **Parameter Optimization and Predictive Performance:** We analyze the relationship between network parameters and predictive performance, demonstrating how state-space modeling contributes to optimal parameterization and enhanced computational reliability.

**Results and Implications:**

Our simulations indicate that spacetime-informed neural architectures exhibit enhanced stability and accuracy in modeling computational processes near event horizons. Neural filtering effectively mitigates quantum noise, maintaining computational integrity under extreme gravitational conditions.
