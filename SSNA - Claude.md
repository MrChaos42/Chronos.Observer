## 1. Introduction

The intersection of astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theory has given rise to new paradigms for understanding and designing computational systems that can operate in extreme physical environments. Recent theoretical work has proposed intriguing concepts such as:

1. The Higgs field as a computation field, where particle interactions give rise to complex computational behaviors.
2. The Event Horizon Computer, a theoretical framework for harnessing the computational power of black holes.

Inspired by these concepts, we propose a novel computational framework that integrates spacetime dynamics and neural network architectures to facilitate robust and secure computations near cosmic boundaries such as event horizons.

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To develop neural architectures that can adapt to and leverage the unique properties of spacetime near cosmic boundaries.
2. To enhance the stability and security of computations in extreme gravitational environments.
3. To explore the theoretical limits of computation in the presence of intense gravitational fields.

Our work has potential implications for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics, pushing the boundaries of computational theory, and developing technologies for future cosmic-scale information processing systems.
